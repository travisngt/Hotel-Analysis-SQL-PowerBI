# Parking Lot Size Analysis

In this analysis, we will examine the need to increase the parking lot size based on personal car usage. The analysis will be based on the available data provided.

## Data

The table below shows the yearly revenue, the sum of required car parking spaces, and the parking percentages for the hotel:

| Year | Sum of Revenue   | Sum of Required Car Parking Spaces | Parking Percentages |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|
| 2018 | 7,116,274.81    | 5,132                             | 2.49%               |
| 2019 | 31,725,386.46   | 20,644                            | 2.50%               |
| 2020 | 20,327,211.92   | 8,922                             | 2.05%               |

## Analysis

Based on the data provided, we can make the following observations:

- There was a significant increase in revenue from 2018 to 2019, followed by a decrease in 2020.
- The number of required car parking spaces increased from 2018 to 2019 and decreased in 2020.
- The parking percentages remained relatively consistent in 2018 and 2019 but decreased in 2020.

## Conclusion

Considering the available data, we can conclude the following:

- There was a substantial increase in parking demand from 2018 to 2019, as indicated by the significant increase in required car parking spaces. This suggests a higher number of guests with personal cars during that period.
- However, there was a decrease in required car parking spaces in 2020, suggesting a potential decrease in parking demand. Further analysis is required to determine whether this decrease is a sustained trend or a temporary deviation.
- To make a definitive determination on the need to increase the parking lot size, it is advisable to collect specific data on personal car usage over a longer period. This data would provide more accurate insights into parking demand and help make informed decisions regarding the parking lot size.

Further analysis and additional data would be required to make a conclusive determination on whether to increase the parking lot size based on personal car usage.
