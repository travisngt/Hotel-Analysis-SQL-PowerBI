# SQL Portfolio: Hotel Analysis with Power BI

In this portfolio, we will explore and analyze hotel data using Power BI to answer specific questions and gain insights into various aspects of the hotel's performance. The focus will be on visualizing data to tell a story and provide valuable information for decision-making. The requirements for this portfolio include:

1. **Build a visual data story or dashboard using Power BI:**
   - Create a visually appealing and interactive dashboard in Power BI to showcase the hotel's growth over the years.
   - Utilize appropriate charts, graphs, and visualizations to present revenue trends, occupancy rates, and other relevant metrics.
   - Include filters and slicers to enable users to explore the data dynamically.

2. **Analyze hotel growth by year and segment revenue by hotel type:**
   - Evaluate the hotel's growth over the years and identify any patterns or trends.
   - Segment the revenue data by different hotel types to understand their respective contributions to overall revenue.
   - Visualize the revenue trends for each hotel type, comparing their growth rates and identifying any differences.

3. **Determine the need to increase parking lot size based on personal car usage:**
   - Analyze data related to guest parking and personal car usage.
   - Explore trends in the number of guests with personal cars over time.
   - Assess the impact of personal car usage on parking lot capacity and determine if there is a need to increase the parking lot size.

4. **Identify trends in average daily rate (ADR) and guest count to explore seasonality:**
   - Analyze ADR and guest count data to identify any patterns or seasonality trends.
   - Visualize the average daily rates and guest counts over time, potentially using line charts or area charts to highlight trends.
   - Identify months or seasons with higher ADR and guest counts and determine if there are any significant variations.

By addressing these requirements and presenting the analysis through an interactive Power BI dashboard, we can gain valuable insights into the hotel's growth, revenue segmentation by hotel type, parking lot utilization, and seasonality trends related to average daily rate and guest count.

Throughout this portfolio, we will use SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate the necessary data and then integrate it into Power BI for visual analysis and storytelling.
